# king_house_prediction
## Description
Project Goal
The King County House Dataset contains a wealth of information about the price, size, location, condition and various other features of houses in Washington’s King County. In this article, I’ll disect how linear regression model in Python can help predict house prices , so that the Real Estate Agency can render constructive advices to homeowners of when they can buy or sell their houses and by what amount.There are several features or factors that should be looked into when performing this task and that what i am going to do.


## Findings
My current preferred model is able to explain about 85% of the variance in the sale prices of homes, which shows that the model is 85% accurate .
The value of the r_squared increase as we add more predictors,with the first one being that of simple linear regression with about 24% accuracy of the model.
All the models are statistically significant having a p_value of less than 0.005
The last model would be an ideal in predicting the current and future prices of the house.


## Recommendation
I would recommend that the Agency adopt the last model since it has a higher r_squared value of 0.85 which translate to 85% accuracy of the model.
Features such as condition , bedrooms, bathrooms, and sqft_living of the house should be put into consideration because they affect prices positively .
By using this model the Agency is able to offer reasonable advices to the homeowners which will inturn help them in knowing how to maximize profits and minimize losses.
